## Summary

A tutorial on how to build a smart blog with a search engine powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. This will allow for natural language queries of the blog's content.

## Why now

RAG models are a powerful new technology that combines the strengths of information retrieval and generative models. Building a RAG-powered search for a blog is a great way to showcase the power of this technology and provide a better user experience for readers.
