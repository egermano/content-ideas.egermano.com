## Experiment plans

### Experiment 1 — Auto-generate a Button component

- Objective: Measure correctness and accessibility of LLM-generated button markup and ARIA attributes.
- Stack: Node.js, Playwright, OpenAI API (key required, estimated $X)
- Steps:
  1. Scaffold a simple component repo...
  2. Prompt LLM with template...
  3. Run Playwright a11y checks...
- Expected: LLM outputs component files; Playwright reports no critical a11y violations.
- Time est: 3–4 hours
- Difficulty: medium
- Safety/privacy/licensing: watch for copied snippets; add license checks.

## Validation checklist

- Technical: run Playwright a11y tests; unit test rendering; snapshot tests.
- SEO quick tests: A/B title: "Generate ARIA-compliant components with LLMs" vs "LLMs for accessible web components"; run a Twitter poll and a 30s teaser video to gauge interest.
- Success metrics: 1,000 views in 2 weeks OR top-3 ranking for target keyword in 3 months (estimated).
