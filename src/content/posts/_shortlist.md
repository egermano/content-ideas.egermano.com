## Recommended Next Action Plan

I recommend starting with one of the "quick win" topics to build momentum and get some content out the door quickly. "Building a Chatbot with the ChatGPT API" is a great choice because it's a very popular topic with a lot of search demand.

Once you've published your first piece of content, I recommend tackling one of the "deep dive" topics. "Fine-Tuning Small Language Models" is a great choice because it's a very hot topic right now and has the potential to be a huge hit with your audience.

Which topic do you want to deep-dive?
