## Summary
A step-by-step guide to building a full-stack web application that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) for a core feature, such as a custom chatbot or a text generation tool. This tutorial is aimed at intermediate web developers with experience in front-end and back-end development but who are new to integrating AI models.

## Why now
The release of powerful and accessible LLM APIs from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google has made it easier than ever for developers to incorporate AI into their applications. There is a high demand for practical, project-based tutorials that go beyond simple API calls and demonstrate how to build a complete, production-ready application.
