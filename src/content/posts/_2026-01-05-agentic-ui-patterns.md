## Summary
An exploration of emerging UI patterns for "agentic" user interfaces, where AI agents can take actions on behalf of the user. This content is for frontend developers and UI/UX designers who are interested in the next generation of user interfaces.

## Why now
The concept of "agentic UI" is gaining traction as AI models become more capable of performing complex tasks. As we move from simple chatbots to more autonomous AI agents, there is a need to establish new UI patterns and best practices for designing and building these interfaces.
