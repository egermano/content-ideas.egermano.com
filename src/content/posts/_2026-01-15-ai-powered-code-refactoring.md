## Summary
This topic covers how to use AI tools to refactor existing codebases, improving readability, maintainability, and performance. It's aimed at intermediate to senior developers who are looking for ways to speed up their refactoring workflows.

## Why now
As codebases grow in complexity, refactoring becomes a critical but time-consuming task. AI-powered tools are now capable of automating significant parts of this process, making it a hot topic for developers looking to improve their productivity.

## Experiment plans
### Experiment 1 — Refactor a "God Component"
- Objective: Use an AI tool to break down a large, complex component into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Stack: A project with a complex component (e.g., a React or Vue monolith), GitHub Copilot or a similar AI tool.
- Steps:
  1. Identify a "god component" in an existing project.
  2. Use an AI tool to suggest ways to break it down.
  3. Apply the suggested changes and measure the impact on code quality metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity).
- Expected: The AI tool provides a clear and effective refactoring plan, resulting in a more maintainable component.
- Time est: 2–3 hours
- Difficulty: low
- Safety/privacy/licensing: Be cautious about sharing proprietary code with third-party AI services.

## Validation checklist
- Technical: Run unit tests and integration tests to ensure the refactored code is still functional.
- SEO quick tests: A/B test titles like "I Used AI to Refactor My Code, Here's What Happened" vs "A Guide to AI-Powered Code Refactoring".
- Success metrics: 1,500 views in 2 weeks OR a top-5 ranking for the target keyword in 3 months (estimated).
