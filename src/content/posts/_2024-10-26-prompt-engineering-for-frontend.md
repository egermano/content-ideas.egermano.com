## Summary
A practical guide to prompt engineering specifically for frontend development tasks, such as generating components, writing tests, and debugging code. This content is for frontend developers who want to get the most out of AI coding assistants.

## Why now
As AI coding assistants become more powerful, prompt engineering is becoming a critical skill for developers. However, most prompt engineering resources are generic; a guide specifically for frontend developers would be highly valuable.

## Experiment plans
### Experiment 1 — A/B test different prompt styles
- Objective: To determine which prompt engineering techniques are most effective for generating high-quality frontend code.
- Stack: An AI coding assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot), a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue).
- Steps:
  1. Define a specific frontend task (e.g., create a responsive card component).
  2. Write several different prompts for the same task, using different techniques (e.g., zero-shot, few-shot, role-playing).
  3. Compare the quality of the generated code from each prompt.
- Expected: A clear understanding of which prompt engineering techniques work best for frontend development.
- Time est: 4-6 hours
- Difficulty: medium
- Safety/privacy/licensing: Be mindful of any sensitive information in your prompts.

## Validation checklist
- Technical: Evaluate the generated code for correctness, completeness, and adherence to best practices.
- SEO quick tests: A/B test titles like "The Prompt Engineering Guide for Frontend Devs" vs. "Stop Writing Bad Prompts: A Guide for Frontend Devs."
- Success metrics: High number of downloads for the cheat sheet.

## Notes/assumptions
- Assumes the user has access to an AI coding assistant.
