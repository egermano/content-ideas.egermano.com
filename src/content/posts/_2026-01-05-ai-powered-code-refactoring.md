## Experiment plans
### Experiment 1 — Refactor a Legacy Code Snippet
- **Objective:** To demonstrate the effectiveness of an AI-powered refactoring tool in a real-world scenario by improving a piece of legacy code.
- **Stack:** A small, self-contained legacy project (e.g., an old jQuery-based JavaScript file or a complex Python script), and an AI refactoring tool like Sourcery.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify a suitable piece of legacy code that is functional but poorly written (e.g., long functions, nested loops, unclear variable names).
  2. Establish a baseline by running a code quality analysis tool (e.g., SonarLint) to get metrics on code smells, complexity, and maintainability.
  3. Use an AI refactoring tool to automatically suggest and apply improvements to the code.
  4. Re-run the code quality analysis to measure the improvements in the same metrics.
  5. Ensure the refactored code still functions as intended by running any existing tests or performing manual UAT.
- **Expected Outputs:** A clear before-and-after comparison of the code, with quantifiable improvements in code quality metrics.
- **Time est:** 2–3 hours
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Safety/privacy/licensing:** Ensure that the legacy code used in the demo does not contain any proprietary or sensitive information.

## Validation checklist
- **Technical validation:** The refactored code must pass all existing unit tests and function identically to the original code.
- **Audience/SEO validation:**
  - **A/B Title Suggestions:** "I Let an AI Refactor My Legacy Code... Here's What Happened" vs. "How to Use AI for Automated Code Refactoring."
  - **Quick Tests:** Post a Gist of the "before" code on Twitter and ask the community for their refactoring suggestions, then compare them to the AI's output.
- **Metrics to track post-publish:**
  - **Video:** Audience retention, comments, likes.
  - **Blog:** Time on page, scroll depth, backlinks.
- **Success thresholds:** 1,000 views on the video in 3 weeks OR ranking in the top 10 for "AI code refactoring" within 4 months.
