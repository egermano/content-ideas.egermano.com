title: 'Fine-Tuning a Small Language Model for Domain-Specific Code Generation'
pubDate: '2024-07-30'
---
## Summary
A look at how to fine-tune smaller, more efficient language models (e.g., CodeLlama, Phi-3) for specific coding tasks, such as generating code for a particular framework or domain-specific language.

## Why now
Fine-tuning smaller models is becoming a cost-effective alternative to using large, general-purpose models. It allows for greater control and specialization, which is valuable for niche applications.
