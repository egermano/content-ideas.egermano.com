## Summary
An exploration of the emerging trend of "agentic" UI patterns, where AI agents act on behalf of the user to complete tasks. This post will analyze examples, discuss design principles, and provide a framework for implementing agentic UIs in web applications.

## Why now
With the increasing sophistication of large language models, the concept of AI agents is moving from theory to practice. Web developers and UI/UX designers are at the forefront of this shift, and understanding how to design for agents is becoming a critical skill.
