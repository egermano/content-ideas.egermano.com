## Summary
A guide on how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate accessible web components with proper ARIA attributes. This tutorial is for intermediate web developers focused on building inclusive and compliant front-ends.

## Why now
There's a growing interest in using LLMs for front-end code generation, but a major concern is the quality and accessibility of the output. This topic addresses that concern head-on, showing how to use AI as a tool to improve, rather than hinder, accessibility.

## Experiment plans
### Experiment 1 — Auto-generate an Accessible Toggle Button
- **Objective**: To verify that an LLM can generate a stateful, accessible toggle button component based on a detailed prompt.
- **Stack**: Node.js, Playwright, an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI API), `tsx` for running scripts.
- **Steps**:
  1.  **Setup**: Initialize a Node.js project and install `playwright` and `openai`.
  2.  **Prompt Engineering**: Craft a precise prompt. Example: *"Generate a single, self-contained HTML file with a toggle button. The button should have two states: 'On' and 'Off'. It must use the `aria-pressed` attribute to indicate its state. The button's text should change on click. Include a `<script>` tag for the toggling logic. Ensure it's fully accessible."*
  3.  **Code Generation**: Write a script (`generate.ts`) that sends this prompt to the LLM API and saves the response as `button.html`.
  4.  **Automated Testing**: Write a Playwright test (`test.ts`) that:
      -   Launches a browser and opens `button.html`.
      -   Checks the initial `aria-pressed` state is `false`.
      -   Clicks the button.
      -   Checks the `aria-pressed` state is now `true`.
      -   Runs Playwright's built-in accessibility scanner (`await page.accessibility.snapshot()`).
- **Expected Outputs**: The LLM generates valid HTML/JS. The Playwright test passes, confirming the state change and finding no critical accessibility violations.
- **Time est**: 3–4 hours
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Safety/licensing**: Generated code should be manually reviewed for any obvious copied snippets.

### Experiment 2 — Generating an Accessible Tab Interface
- **Objective**: To test the LLM's ability to generate a more complex, multi-part component with correct ARIA roles and relationships.
- **Stack**: Same as Experiment 1.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Prompt Engineering**: Craft a prompt for a tabbed interface. Example: *"Create an accessible tab interface with three tabs. Use `role='tablist'`, `role='tab'`, and `role='tabpanel'`. Ensure keyboard navigation (left/right arrows) works correctly between tabs, and that `aria-selected` and `tabindex` are managed properly."*
  2. **Code Generation**: Use the script from Experiment 1 to generate `tabs.html`.
  3. **Automated Testing**: Write a Playwright test that:
      -   Verifies the correct initial ARIA attributes.
      -   Simulates keyboard navigation (`await page.keyboard.press('ArrowRight')`) and checks that focus and `aria-selected` attributes update correctly.
      -   Runs the accessibility scanner.
- **Expected Outputs**: A functional and accessible tab interface. The tests should pass, demonstrating correct keyboard interaction and ARIA state management.
- **Time est**: 4–5 hours
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High

## Validation checklist
- **Technical**: Run Playwright accessibility tests; unit test rendering; snapshot tests; manually verify with VoiceOver/NVDA.
- **SEO quick tests**: A/B title: "Generate ARIA-compliant components with LLMs" vs "Let AI Fix Your Accessibility Bugs"; run a Twitter poll asking "Do you trust AI-generated front-end code for accessibility?"
- **Success metrics**: 1,000 views in 2 weeks OR top-3 ranking for "accessible web components AI" in 3 months (estimated).
