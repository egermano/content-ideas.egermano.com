## Summary

A tutorial on how to use AI-powered tools to refactor a legacy codebase, improving its readability, maintainability, and performance. This guide is for intermediate web developers working with established, complex projects.

## Why now

As AI coding assistants become more sophisticated, they are moving beyond simple code completion to offer powerful refactoring capabilities. With many companies managing aging codebases, there's a significant demand for efficient ways to modernize and improve code quality without a complete rewrite.

## Experiment plans

### Experiment 1 — Refactor a spaghetti code function

- Objective: Measure the effectiveness of an AI tool in refactoring a complex, poorly written JavaScript function.
- Stack: Node.js, a sample legacy JavaScript file, GitHub Copilot or Tabnine.
- Steps:
  1. Identify a complex function with high cyclomatic complexity.
  2. Write unit tests to cover the function's current behavior.
  3. Use the AI assistant to suggest a refactored version of the function.
  4. Run the unit tests against the refactored code to ensure correctness.
- Expected: The AI tool produces a refactored function that is more readable, maintainable, and passes all unit tests.
- Time est: 2–3 hours
- Difficulty: medium
- Safety/privacy/licensing: Ensure that the code being refactored does not contain any sensitive information.

## Validation checklist

- Technical: The refactored code must pass all existing and new unit tests.
- SEO quick tests: A/B test titles like "Refactor Your Legacy Code with AI" vs. "A Practical Guide to AI-Powered Code Refactoring".
- Success metrics: 1,500 views in the first month and a top-5 ranking for "AI code refactoring" within 4 months.
