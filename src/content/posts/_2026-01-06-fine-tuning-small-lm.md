## Summary

A technical guide to fine-tuning a small language model (e.g., GPT-2, CodeT5) for domain-specific code generation. This post will cover the entire process, from data preparation to model training and evaluation.

## Why now

As large language models become more powerful, there is a growing interest in fine-tuning smaller, more efficient models for specific tasks. This post will provide a timely and valuable resource for developers looking to build their own custom code generation models.
