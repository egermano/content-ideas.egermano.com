## Experiment plans

### Experiment 1 — Build a simple "food ordering" agentic UI

- Objective: To demonstrate the principles of agentic UI by building a simple food ordering chatbot.
- Stack: Node.js, a frontend framework like React or Vue, a chatbot library, and an LLM API.
- Steps:
  1. Design a simple UI with a text input for the user to state their goal (e.g., "I want a pizza").
  2. Use an LLM to parse the user's goal and extract the relevant information (e.g., food item, quantity).
  3. Display the results to the user and allow them to confirm the order.
- Expected: The user can order food by stating their goal in natural language.
- Time est: 6–8 hours
- Difficulty: high
- Safety/privacy/licensing: Ensure that the LLM API is used responsibly and that user data is handled securely.

## Validation checklist

- Technical: The agentic UI should correctly interpret user goals and provide accurate results.
- SEO quick tests: A/B test titles like "The Future of UI is Agentic" vs. "A Deep Dive into Agentic UI Patterns".
- Success metrics: 2,000 views in the first month and a top-3 ranking for "agentic UI" within 6 months.
