## Experiment plans
### Experiment 1 — Head-to-Head Feature Comparison
- **Objective:** To objectively compare the core AI features of Cursor and VS Code with the GitHub Copilot extension on a standardized set of development tasks.
- **Stack:** Node.js, React, a small open-source project for the testbed.
- **Steps:**
  1. Set up a local development environment with both Cursor and VS Code + Copilot.
  2. Choose a small, open-source React project to use as a testbed.
  3. Perform a series of identical tasks in both editors, such as:
     - Generating a new UI component from a text prompt.
     - Refactoring a complex function to improve readability.
     - Debugging a known issue in the codebase.
     - Asking the AI assistant a question about a specific part of the code.
  4. Record the time taken, the quality of the AI-generated output, and the overall user experience for each task.
- **Expected Outputs:** A detailed comparison table with qualitative and quantitative data on the performance of each editor, including screenshots and screen recordings.
- **Time est:** 3–4 hours
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Safety/privacy/licensing:** No significant issues, but ensure that no private API keys or sensitive data are exposed in screen recordings.

## Validation checklist
- **Technical validation:** Ensure that any code generated or refactored by the AI tools is correct, functional, and passes any existing tests in the project.
- **Audience/SEO validation:**
  - **A/B Title Suggestions:** "Cursor AI Editor Review: The VS Code Killer?" vs. "Cursor vs. VS Code + Copilot: An Honest Comparison."
  - **Quick Tests:** Run a poll on Twitter asking developers which AI coding assistant they prefer. Post a short teaser video on LinkedIn showcasing one of the comparison tasks.
- **Metrics to track post-publish:**
  - **Video:** Views, watch time, click-through rate (CTR).
  - **Blog:** Bounce rate, dwell time, SERP rank for "Cursor code editor review."
