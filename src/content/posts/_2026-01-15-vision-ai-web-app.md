## Experiment plans
### Experiment 1 — Build a "What's in My Fridge?" App
- Objective: Use a vision AI model to identify the ingredients in a user's fridge and suggest recipes.
- Stack: A front-end framework (e.g., React or Vue), a vision AI API (e.g., Google Cloud Vision or Amazon Rekognition), a recipe API.
- Steps:
  1. Build a front-end that allows users to upload a picture of their fridge.
  2. Use a vision AI API to identify the ingredients in the picture.
  3. Use a recipe API to find recipes that can be made with the identified ingredients.
  4. Display the recipes to the user.
- Expected: The app can accurately identify ingredients and suggest relevant recipes.
- Time est: 10–15 hours
- Difficulty: medium
- Safety/privacy/licensing: Be mindful of user privacy and ensure that any images are handled securely.

## Validation checklist
- Technical: Test the app with a variety of images to ensure it's accurately identifying ingredients.
- SEO quick tests: A/B test different app descriptions and calls to action.
- Success metrics: A high level of user engagement, positive reviews in the app store.

## Notes/assumptions
- This project will require a good understanding of front-end development and how to work with APIs.
- The cost of using a vision AI API can be a factor, especially for a high-traffic app.
