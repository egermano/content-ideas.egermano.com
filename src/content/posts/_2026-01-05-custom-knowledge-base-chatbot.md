## Summary
A tutorial on how to build a chatbot that can answer questions based on a custom knowledge base, using techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector databases. This content is for intermediate developers who want to build more sophisticated and useful AI-powered chatbots.

## Why now
Generic, pre-trained chatbots are often insufficient for business-specific use cases. The ability to create chatbots that can access and reason about private or proprietary data is a highly sought-after skill. The development of open-source tools and managed services for RAG has made this more accessible than ever.
