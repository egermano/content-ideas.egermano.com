## Experiment plans
### Experiment 1 — Build a Semantic Search Engine for Your Website
- Objective: Use a vector database to create a search engine that understands the meaning of a user's query, not just the keywords.
- Stack: Python, a vector database (e.g., Pinecone or Chroma), an embedding model, a web framework (e.g., Flask or Django).
- Steps:
  1. Scrape the content of your website.
  2. Use an embedding model to create vector embeddings of your content.
  3. Store the embeddings in a vector database.
  4. Build a search engine that takes a user's query, creates an embedding of the query, and retrieves the most similar content from the vector database.
- Expected: The search engine provides more relevant results than a traditional keyword-based search engine.
- Time est: 8–12 hours
- Difficulty: medium
- Safety/privacy/licensing: Be mindful of the data you're storing in the vector database and ensure it's handled securely.

## Validation checklist
- Technical: Test the search engine with a variety of queries to ensure it's providing relevant results.
- SEO quick tests: A/B test the new search engine against your existing search engine to see which one performs better.
- Success metrics: A higher click-through rate on search results, positive feedback from users.

## Notes/assumptions
- This project will require a good understanding of vector embeddings and semantic search.
- The cost of using a vector database can be a factor, especially for large websites.
